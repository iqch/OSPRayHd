///
/// An HdOSPRay representation of a subdivision surface or poly-mesh object.
/// This class is an example of a hydra Rprim, or renderable object, and it
/// gets created on a call to HdRenderIndex::InsertRprim() with a type of
/// HdPrimTypeTokens->mesh.
///
/// The prim object's main function is to bridge the scene description and the
/// renderable representation. The Hydra image generation algorithm will call
/// HdRenderIndex::SyncAll() before any drawing; this, in turn, will call
/// Sync() for each mesh with new data.
///
/// Sync() is passed a set of dirtyBits, indicating which scene buffers are
/// dirty. It uses these to pull all of the new scene data and constructs
/// updated ospray geometry objects.  Rebuilding the acceleration datastructures
/// is deferred to HdOSPRayRenderDelegate::CommitResources(), which runs after
/// all prims have been updated. After running Sync() for each prim and
/// HdOSPRayRenderDelegate::CommitResources(), the scene should be ready for
/// rendering via ray queries.
///
/// An rprim's state is lazily populated in Sync(); matching this, Finalize()
/// does the heavy work of releasing state (such as handles into the top-level
/// ospray scene), so that object population and existence aren't tied to
/// each other.
